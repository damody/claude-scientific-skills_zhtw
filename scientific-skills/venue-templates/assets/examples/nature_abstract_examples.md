## 範例 1：分子生物學 / 細胞生物學

**主題**：CRISPR 基因編輯發現

```
The ability to precisely edit DNA sequences in living cells has transformed
biological research and holds promise for treating genetic diseases. However,
current genome editing tools can introduce unwanted mutations at off-target
sites, limiting their clinical potential. Here we describe prime editing, a
versatile and precise genome editing method that directly writes new genetic
information into a specified DNA site using a reverse transcriptase fused to a
CRISPR nickase. Prime editing can make all 12 types of point mutations, as
well as small insertions and deletions, with minimal off-target editing and
without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. In human cells,
we used prime editing to correct the primary genetic causes of sickle cell
disease and Tay-Sachs disease, and to install protective mutations that
reduce risk of prion disease. Prime editing expands the scope and capabilities
of genome editing and may address approximately 89% of known human genetic
disease variants.

## 範例 2：神經科學

**主題**：記憶鞏固機制

```
Sleep is essential for memory consolidation, yet how the sleeping brain
transforms labile memories into stable long-term representations remains
poorly understood. We used multi-site electrophysiology in freely behaving
mice to record the activity of thousands of neurons across hippocampus and
cortex during learning and subsequent sleep. We discovered that specific
neurons that encode a newly learned memory reactivate in precisely timed
sequences during slow-wave sleep, with hippocampal reactivation preceding
cortical reactivation by 10-15 milliseconds. Optogenetic disruption of this
temporal coordination impaired memory retention by 78%, whereas artificial
enhancement of the temporal relationship strengthened memories beyond normal
levels. These results reveal that the temporal ordering of hippocampal-cortical
replay is not merely correlative but causally necessary for memory
consolidation. Our findings suggest new therapeutic approaches for memory
disorders based on optimizing the temporal dynamics of sleep.

## 範例 3：氣候科學

**主題**：碳循環回饋

```
Arctic permafrost contains approximately 1,500 billion tonnes of organic
carbon—twice the amount currently in the atmosphere. As the Arctic warms,
this carbon may be released to the atmosphere, accelerating global warming
through a positive feedback loop. However, the magnitude and timing of this
feedback remain highly uncertain because microbial decomposition rates in
thawing permafrost are poorly constrained. Here we present a 15-year
field experiment across 25 sites spanning the Arctic, tracking carbon
fluxes in warming permafrost under natural conditions. We find that
microbial respiration increases exponentially with temperature until soils
reach 3°C, then plateaus due to substrate limitation—a threshold effect
not captured by current Earth system models. Our results suggest that
permafrost carbon feedback will be 30-50% lower than current projections
during this century, providing more time to limit warming, but will
accelerate dramatically if deep permafrost begins to thaw.

## 範例 4：物理學 / 材料科學

**主題**：室溫超導

```
Superconductivity—the flow of electricity without resistance—has been
confined to extremely low temperatures since its discovery over a century
ago, limiting practical applications. The recent demonstration of
superconductivity in hydrogen-rich materials at high pressure has raised
hopes for higher transition temperatures, but achieving room-temperature
superconductivity at ambient pressure has remained elusive. Here we report
superconductivity at 21°C (294 K) in a nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride
(Lu-N-H) compound at pressures of approximately 1 GPa—nearly ambient
conditions. Electrical resistance drops to zero below the transition
temperature with a sharp transition width of 2 K, and we observe the Meissner
effect confirming bulk superconductivity. Density functional theory
calculations suggest that nitrogen incorporation stabilizes the high-symmetry
structure that enables strong electron-phonon coupling. These results
establish a pathway toward practical room-temperature superconductors.

## 範例 5：演化學 / 生態學

**主題**：對氣候的快速演化反應

```
Climate change is driving rapid shifts in the geographic distributions of
species, but whether organisms can adapt quickly enough to keep pace with
warming remains a critical question for biodiversity conservation. Here we
document real-time evolution in wild populations of a widespread forest tree,
Scots pine, along a 1,000 km latitudinal gradient in Scandinavia. By combining
whole-genome sequencing with phenotypic measurements across 25 common gardens,
we detect signatures of selection at 47 loci associated with cold tolerance,
phenology, and drought resistance over just 50 years—approximately
five tree generations. Alleles conferring warmer-adapted phenotypes have
increased in frequency by 4-12% across northern populations, matching
predictions from models of climate-driven selection. However, migration of
warm-adapted genotypes from the south appears limited by geographic barriers.
These results demonstrate that trees can evolve rapidly in response to
climate change but suggest that assisted gene flow may be necessary to
prevent local maladaptation.
