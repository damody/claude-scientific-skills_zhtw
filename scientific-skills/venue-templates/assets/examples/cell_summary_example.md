## 完整範例 1：衰老與老化

### Summary（最多 150 字）

```
Cellular senescence is a stress response that prevents damaged cell
proliferation but can drive tissue dysfunction through the senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP). How senescent cells resist
apoptosis despite expressing pro-apoptotic p53 has remained unclear.
Here, we identify FOXO4 as a pivotal mediator of senescent cell viability.
FOXO4 is highly expressed in senescent cells and directly interacts with
p53, retaining it in the nucleus and preventing p53-mediated apoptosis.
A cell-permeable peptide that disrupts FOXO4-p53 interaction selectively
induces p53 nuclear exclusion and apoptosis in senescent cells without
affecting proliferating cells. In vivo, this FOXO4 peptide neutralizes
doxorubicin-induced senescent cells and restores fitness, fur density,
and renal function in naturally aged mice. These findings establish
FOXO4-mediated p53 sequestration as a senescence-specific survival
pathway and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeted senescent
cell elimination.
```

### Highlights（每條不超過 85 字元）

```
• FOXO4 is selectively upregulated in senescent cells and binds p53

• FOXO4-p53 interaction retains p53 in the nucleus, preventing apoptosis

• A FOXO4-targeting peptide induces apoptosis specifically in senescent cells

• FOXO4 peptide treatment restores fitness and organ function in aged mice
```

### eTOC Blurb（30-50 字）

```
Baar et al. identify FOXO4 as a critical mediator of senescent cell survival
through p53 sequestration. A peptide disrupting FOXO4-p53 interaction
selectively eliminates senescent cells and restores tissue function in
aged mice, establishing proof-of-concept for targeted senolytic therapy.
```

### In Brief（簡述）（1 句話）

```
A FOXO4-targeting peptide selectively eliminates senescent cells by
releasing p53, restoring tissue function in aged mice.

## 完整範例 2：基因組結構

### Summary（最多 150 字）

```
The three-dimensional organization of chromosomes within the nucleus
influences gene expression, DNA replication, and genome stability.
Phase separation has emerged as a potential mechanism for organizing
nuclear contents, but whether condensates can shape chromosome
structure in vivo remains unknown. Here, we show that the transcriptional
coactivator BRD4 forms liquid-like condensates at super-enhancers that
organize associated chromatin into hub structures. Optogenetic induction
of BRD4 condensates is sufficient to remodel chromosome topology and
activate transcription within minutes. Conversely, disruption of BRD4
condensates with the small molecule JQ1 dissolves chromatin hubs and
rapidly silences super-enhancer-controlled genes. Single-molecule
tracking reveals that condensate formation increases the local
concentration of transcription machinery 100-fold, explaining the
transcriptional potency of super-enhancers. These results establish
phase separation as a mechanism for chromatin organization and
transcriptional control with implications for understanding and
targeting oncogenic super-enhancers.
```

### Highlights

```
• BRD4 forms liquid condensates at super-enhancers in living cells

• BRD4 condensates organize chromatin into transcriptionally active hubs

• Optogenetic condensate induction rapidly remodels chromatin topology

• Condensates concentrate transcription machinery 100-fold locally
```

### eTOC Blurb

```
Sabari et al. demonstrate that BRD4 forms phase-separated condensates
at super-enhancers that organize chromatin into hub structures and
concentrate transcription machinery. Optogenetic manipulation reveals
that condensate formation directly drives chromatin remodeling and
transcriptional activation.

## 完整範例 3：代謝與免疫

### Summary（最多 150 字）

```
Immune cells undergo dramatic metabolic reprogramming upon activation,
switching from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. This
metabolic shift is thought to support the biosynthetic demands of
rapid proliferation, but whether specific metabolites directly regulate
immune cell function remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that
the glycolytic metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) sustains T cell
receptor signaling by inhibiting sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase
(SERCA) activity. PEP accumulates in activated T cells and directly
binds SERCA, preventing calcium reuptake and prolonging store-operated
calcium entry. Genetic or pharmacological enhancement of PEP levels
augments T cell effector function and anti-tumor immunity in vivo.
Conversely, tumor-derived lactate suppresses PEP levels and impairs
T cell calcium signaling, contributing to tumor immune evasion. These
findings reveal an unexpected signaling role for a glycolytic
intermediate and suggest metabolic strategies to enhance T cell
responses in cancer immunotherapy.
```

### Highlights

```
• Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) accumulates during T cell activation

• PEP directly binds and inhibits SERCA to sustain calcium signaling

• Enhancing PEP levels augments anti-tumor T cell immunity

• Tumor lactate suppresses T cell PEP levels and calcium signaling
```

### eTOC Blurb

```
Ho et al. discover that the glycolytic metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate
directly regulates T cell calcium signaling by inhibiting SERCA. This
metabolic-signaling link is exploited by tumors through lactate
secretion and offers new targets for cancer immunotherapy.
