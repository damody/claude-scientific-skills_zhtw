BACKGROUND
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce cardiovascular
events in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular
disease. Whether these benefits extend to patients with heart failure and
reduced ejection fraction, regardless of diabetes status, is unknown.

METHODS
We randomly assigned 4,744 patients with heart failure and an ejection
fraction of 40% or less to receive dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or
placebo, in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a
composite of worsening heart failure (hospitalization or urgent visit
requiring intravenous therapy) or cardiovascular death.

RESULTS
Over a median of 18.2 months, the primary outcome occurred in 386 of
2,373 patients (16.3%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 502 of 2,371
patients (21.2%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.85; P<0.001). A first worsening heart failure
event occurred in 237 patients (10.0%) in the dapagliflozin group and
in 326 patients (13.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95%
CI, 0.59 to 0.83). Death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 227
patients (9.6%) and 273 patients (11.5%), respectively (hazard ratio,
0.82; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.98). Effects were similar in patients with and
without diabetes. Serious adverse events were similar between groups.

CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction,
dapagliflozin reduced the risk of worsening heart failure or
cardiovascular death, regardless of the presence of diabetes.

### 範例 2：觀察性研究

BACKGROUND
Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) has been associated with
adverse outcomes in observational studies, but causality remains uncertain.
The relationship between PPI use and chronic kidney disease is unclear.

METHODS
We conducted a prospective cohort study using data from 10,482 participants
in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study who were free of kidney
disease at baseline. PPI use was ascertained at baseline and follow-up
visits. The primary outcome was incident chronic kidney disease, defined
as an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml per minute per
1.73 m² of body-surface area.

RESULTS
Over a median follow-up of 13.9 years, incident chronic kidney disease
occurred in 56.0 per 1000 person-years among PPI users and in 42.0 per
1000 person-years among non-users (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.50; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 1.96). The association persisted after
adjustment for potential confounders, including indication for PPI use
and baseline kidney function. Sensitivity analyses using propensity-score
matching yielded similar results. No association was observed for
histamine H2-receptor antagonist use (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.87
to 1.34).

CONCLUSIONS
PPI use was associated with an increased risk of incident chronic kidney
disease in this community-based cohort. These findings warrant cautious
use of PPIs and further investigation to establish causality.

BACKGROUND
Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in hospitalized patients
with COVID-19 requiring respiratory support. We aimed to evaluate whether
higher doses of corticosteroids would provide additional benefit in
patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

METHODS
In this randomized, controlled, open-label trial conducted at 18 hospitals
in Brazil, we assigned patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (PaO2/FiO2
≤200 mm Hg) to receive high-dose dexamethasone (20 mg once daily for 5
days, then 10 mg once daily for 5 days) or standard dexamethasone (6 mg
once daily for 10 days). The primary outcome was ventilator-free days
at 28 days.

FINDINGS
Between June 17, 2020, and September 20, 2021, we enrolled 299 patients
(151 assigned to high-dose dexamethasone and 148 to standard
dexamethasone). The mean number of ventilator-free days at 28 days was
14·2 (SD 10·8) in the high-dose group and 15·5 (SD 10·4) in the standard
group (difference, −1·3 days; 95% CI, −3·9 to 1·3; P=0·32). There was
no significant difference in 28-day mortality (high dose 35·8% vs
standard 31·8%; hazard ratio 1·16; 95% CI, 0·79 to 1·70). Hyperglycemia
requiring insulin was more frequent with high-dose dexamethasone (66·0%
vs 53·4%; P=0·027).

INTERPRETATION
In patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia, high-dose
dexamethasone did not improve ventilator-free days and was associated
with increased hyperglycemia compared with standard-dose dexamethasone.
These findings do not support the use of high-dose corticosteroids in
COVID-19.

IMPORTANCE
Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduces
mortality but identifies many indeterminate pulmonary nodules, leading
to unnecessary invasive procedures. Improved risk prediction could
reduce harms while preserving benefits.

OBJECTIVE
To develop and validate a deep learning model for predicting malignancy
risk of lung nodules detected on screening CT.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
This retrospective cohort study included 14,851 participants with
lung nodules from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) for model
development and 5,402 participants from an independent multi-site
validation cohort (2016-2019). Data analysis was performed from
January to November 2022.

EXPOSURES
Deep learning model prediction of malignancy risk based on CT imaging.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
The primary outcome was lung cancer diagnosis within 2 years. Model
performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and comparison
with radiologist assessments.

RESULTS
In the validation cohort (median age, 65 years; 57% male), 312 nodules
(5.8%) were diagnosed as lung cancer within 2 years. The deep learning
model achieved an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.96), compared with 0.85
(95% CI, 0.82-0.88) for the Lung-RADS categorization used by radiologists
(P<0.001). At 95% sensitivity, the model achieved 68% specificity compared
with 38% for Lung-RADS, corresponding to a 49% reduction in false-positive
nodules requiring follow-up. The model's performance was consistent across
subgroups defined by nodule size, location, and patient demographics.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
A deep learning model for lung nodule malignancy prediction outperformed
current clinical standards and could substantially reduce false-positive
findings in lung cancer screening, decreasing unnecessary surveillance
and invasive procedures.

OBJECTIVE
To examine the association between statin use and risk of Parkinson's
disease in a large population-based cohort.

DESIGN
Prospective cohort study.

SETTING
UK Biobank, 2006-2021.

PARTICIPANTS
402,251 adults aged 40-69 years without Parkinson's disease at baseline.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Incident Parkinson's disease identified through hospital admissions,
primary care records, and death certificates. Hazard ratios were
estimated using Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, education,
smoking, alcohol, physical activity, body mass index, and comorbidities.

RESULTS
Over a median follow-up of 12.3 years, 2,841 participants developed
Parkinson's disease (incidence rate 5.7 per 10,000 person-years).
Statin use at baseline was not associated with incident Parkinson's
disease (adjusted hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to
1.04). Results were consistent across analyses stratified by statin
type (lipophilic vs hydrophilic), dose, and duration of use, and in
sensitivity analyses accounting for reverse causation. No protective
association was observed in analyses restricted to participants with
high cardiovascular risk or in propensity-score matched cohorts.

CONCLUSIONS
In this large prospective cohort, statin use was not associated with
reduced risk of Parkinson's disease, contrary to findings from some
previous observational studies. The null findings were robust across
multiple sensitivity analyses. These results do not support a
neuroprotective effect of statins against Parkinson's disease.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Previous observational studies have yielded inconsistent results
regarding statin use and Parkinson's disease risk.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
This large prospective study with long follow-up found no evidence
that statin use protects against Parkinson's disease.

## 醫學摘要常見錯誤

❌ **缺少信賴區間**：「HR 0.75, P=0.02」→ 應包含 95% CI
❌ **只有相對風險**：應加上絕對風險降低、NNT
❌ **觀察性研究使用因果語言**：「PPIs cause kidney disease」
❌ **過度誇大結論**：聲稱超出證據
❌ **缺少樣本數**：應總是包含每組的 N
❌ **模糊的結局**：「Improved outcomes」卻沒有具體定義
